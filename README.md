# AuthDemo System (COMP 2406)

A **Deno-based authentication and session management system** built to securely manage users, hashed passwords, and active sessions.  
This project demonstrates how to handle session creation, expiration, and analysis using database-backed logic.

---

## Features
- Implements **user login** and **session tracking**
- Uses `crypto.randomUUID()` to generate unique session IDs  
- Hashes and verifies passwords for secure authentication  
- Automatically **expires inactive sessions**
- Stores filenames and submission contents in the database  
- Provides an **analysis page** showing total submissions and empty answers  
- Returns structured **HTTP responses** for user errors and login validation  

---

## Core Concepts
- Secure authentication flow (Login â†’ Session â†’ Expiration)
- **Password hashing and verification**
- Managing active user sessions in memory and database
- **Error handling** for invalid credentials and expired sessions
- Database schema design for user and submission data
- Data analysis generation in Deno

## How It Works
1. Users log in with credentials.  
2. Server hashes passwords and validates against stored data.  
3. A unique session ID is created using `crypto.randomUUID()`.  
4. Session is tracked and expires after inactivity.  
5. Admin pages display total submissions and analysis results.
